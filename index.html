        <h2><a name="About" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>
	
<p>I'm a research scientist at RWS working on machine translation, based in the UK. My PhD was at the Cambridge University Engineering Department, working in the machine intelligence lab. In 2021 I defended my <a href="thesis.html">PhD thesis</a>, titled  "Domain adaptation for neural machine translation".</p>
	
<p>In undergraduate I studied information and computer engineering, with a masters project focused on keyword spotting for low-resource languages.</p>
	
<p>My main research interests are around controlling the generation of natural language, especially machine translation. Outside of research, I enjoy learning fragments of different languages, practicing martial arts and baking bread.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jun 23: I will be attending EAMT in Tampere, and especially the first Gender-Inclusive Translation Technologies (GITT) workshop there - giving a keynote on the practicalities of gender-inclusive MT at the workshop, as well as presenting our paper on gender-ambiguous translation.
<li>Apr 23: I will be giving a talk on 'Difficult inputs for machine translation' at a <a href="https://tew23.b2match.io">Translating Europe Workshop</a> organised by TH KÃ¶ln</li>
<li>Oct 22: My <a href="https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/13566">survey of domain and multi-domain adaptation for neural machine translation</a> has been published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research</li>
<li>Jun 22: A little further from my usual presentations, I'm giving a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rdMzOIPqSA">talk at EMFCamp</a> about the Universal Translator in Star Trek, and how realistic - or not - it might be...
<li>Jun 22: I am very grateful to have received this year's EAMT Best Thesis Award. I will be presenting my work on domain adaptation for NMT at EAMT in Ghent.</li>
<li>May 22: Our <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.301/">paper on getting machine translation to produce better gender translations without changing the system</a> is appearing in Findings of ACL and I'll be virtually presenting at the conference Gathertown</li>
<li>Oct 21: The Goethe-Institut is running a hackathon on AI language and bias, for which I'm running one of the challenges. <a href="https://www.goethe.de/prj/one/en/aco/ver/hac.html">Find out more here!</a>
<li>Feb 21: I have defended my thesis on domain adaptation for neural machine translation.</li>

	<h2><a name="Research" class="anchor" href="#research"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research</h2>
	
<p> My research interests are currently focused around domain adaptation for natural language processing, especially machine translation. When adapting, the aim is to make existing systems work better on new topics or genres of text. At the moment I'm particularly interested in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Domain adaptation for neural machine translation - the topic of my PhD</li>
    <li>Fine-tuning translation models for better performance while preserving generality</li>
    <li>Helping models translate new, previously unseen words or characters</li>
    <li>Avoiding problems from tuning on "flawed" translation data</li>
    <li>The effect of gender biases in data on machine translation into languages with grammatical gender</li>
</ul>
