<a name="About" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h1>I
	I'm a research scientist at SDL working on machine translation, based in the UK. I did my PhD at the Cambridge University Engineering Department, working in the machine intelligence lab. I have recently submitted my PhD thesis, titled  "Domain adaptation for neural machine translation", and am currently awaiting viva!
	
	Previously I completed a four year Engineering MEng, also at Cambridge University Engineering Department. The course covered eight different fields of engineering from structures and materials to software and information theory for the first two years, after which I specialized in Information and Computer Engineering for two years. My masters project focused on keyword spotting for low-resource languages.
	
This site contains some information about my research interests and related activities. Outside of research, I enjoy learning fragments of different languages, baking bread, and kickboxing. To contact me about any of these things, mail danielleclairesaunders at gmail dotcom. 

	

<a name="Research" class="anchor" href="#research"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research</h1>
<p> My research interests are currently focused around domain adaptation for natural language processing, especially machine translation. When adapting, the aim is to make existing systems work better on new topics or genres of text. At the moment I'm particularly interested in:
  <ul>
    <li>Domain adaptation for neural machine translation - the topic of my PhD</li>
    <li>Fine-tuning translation models for better performance while preserving generality</li>
    <li>Helping models translate new, previously unseen words or characters</li>
    <li>Avoiding problems from tuning on "flawed" translation data</li>
    <li>The effect of gender biases in data on machine translation into languages with grammatical gender</li>
</ul>
